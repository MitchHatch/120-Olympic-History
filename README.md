Project Title:
120 Years of Olympic History Data analysis

Team Members:
Mitchell Hatchett
Andrew Giannettino
Tetyana Spielmann
Jaylen Whittaker
David Scott

Project Description/Outline:
This dataset contains historical information on the modern Olympic Games, covering all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The dataset consists of 271,000 records, with each row representing an individual athlete participating in a specific Olympic event. The data was sourced from the www.sports-reference.com website. The significance of this dataset is heightened as the USA is gearing up to host the next Olympic Games in 2028.

The dataset contains 15 key features:
ID - Unique number for each athlete
Name - Athlete's name
Sex - M or F
Age - Integer
Height - In centimeters
Weight - In kilograms
Team - Team name
NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
Games - Year and season
Year - Integer
Season - Summer or Winter
City - Host city
Sport - Sport
Event - Event
Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

Visualizations:
Heat map to represent the countries that have won the most medals
Chart: Top 10 countries with gold medals
Filters: countries, sex, season
Graph: Athletes that won most medals
Chart: most medals sorted by age

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Each group member with collaborate on tasks such as cleaning, processing, and analyzing the data; storing the data into adatabase; creating an ETL workflow; generating visualizations; working on documentation; and presenting a summary.
